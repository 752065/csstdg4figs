# csstdg4figs

This repository contains the base files used to create the figures for [_CSS: The Definitive Guide, 4th Edition_](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920012726.do).  I mostly did this by loading them up in Firefox and using the `screenshot` command-line utility (see “[Essential Tool: Firefox’s screenshot Command](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2015/10/22/firefoxs-screenshot-command/)” for more information).

## Notes

* If you want an easy-to-browse method of access, load the repo-root-level `index.html` in a web browser and surf from there.  Also [available on GitHub Pages](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg4figs/).
* Each chapter’s page lists all of the figures’ captions in the order they appear in the book.  Where a caption is a link, it leads to the files used to create the figure in question.  Where it’s unlinked text, there are no files to see.  (Thus: if a figure is a diagram that wasn’t created in-browser, it will be listed but not linked.)
* The files for the chapter “Specificity and the Cascade” went missing at some point, probably in 2008 or so.  I intend to recreate them in the near future.
* What you see in your browser may or may not match what’s shown in the book’s figure.  I have made essentially no effort to vendor-prefix or otherwise work around cross-browser limitations, except where doing so was germane to the content in the actual book.  When in doubt, see the book for compatibility information.
