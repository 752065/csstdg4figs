# csstdg4figs

This repository contains the base files used to create the figures for _CSS: The Definitive Guide, 4th Edition_.

Notes:

* Not every chapter is represented here, since I’m sharing writing duties with Estelle Weyl, and some of the early chapters’ figure files have gone missing.
* Not every figure in the final book(s) is or will be represented here, as on rare occasions I find it easier to create figures via other means.
* Not every figure will work in every browser.  I have made no effort to vendor-prefix or otherwise work around cross-browser limitations.
* The file names are based on the figures’ captions, not the figure numbers shown in the book(s).  Trust me, it was easier this way.
