# csstdg4figs

This repository contains the base files used to create the figures for _CSS: The Definitive Guide, 4th Edition_.

## Notes

* Not every chapter is represented here, mostly because I’m sharing writing duties with Estelle Weyl and so only have the figures for the chapters I wrote.  Except for the Specificity and the Cascade chapter, whose figure files have gone missing. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
* Not every figure in the final book is or will be represented here, as on rare occasions I find it easier to create figures via other means.
* Not every figure will work in every browser.  I have made no effort to vendor-prefix or otherwise work around cross-browser limitations, except where doing so was germane to the content in the actual book.
* The file names are based on the figures’ captions, not the figure numbers shown in the book(s).  Trust me, it was easier this way.  There will be indexes listing the figures by figure number and caption, linking to the specific files used, or noting when they are not available.  This change is expected to happen before the book is published, but no promises.
* There may sometimes be files and images from the third edition to be found.  They were used for reference, and I just didn’t go to the effort of removing or .gitignoring them.  They are likely to be removed in an upcoming reorganization, unless I decide otherwise.  Or choose not to decide, which still means I’ve made a choice.
